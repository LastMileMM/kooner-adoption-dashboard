Steven: Never experienced such delay vs prior vendors.<br><br><strong>Safety/Compliance Failures:</strong> Truck 21 passed Federal DOT but failed MN inspection with visible drag link issues. Truck 20 had 5 federal DOT failures caught by external shop. Wrong stickers on wrong vehicles.<br><br><strong>Work Quality:</strong> Truck 1 urgent WO at 8am, tech sat idle until 12:15pm. WOs marked complete when repairs not finished. Multiple recreations needed.<br><br><strong>Root Causes:</strong> Coverage gaps across shifts, tech (Michael) attendance/training issues, no escalation protocols, DSPs unclear on contacts.<br><br><strong>Solutions Discussed:</strong> David (experienced manager tech) deploying next week for training/oversight. Formal dispatch schedule being created. This is 2nd escalation - relationship at risk.",
